# Data-Wrangling-Project


YouTube Comment Classification and Sentiment Analysis

Objective of the Project : 
The objective of the project is to develop an analytical application utilizing most of the concepts learnt in this course, which can derive topic of the subject presented in any given youtube video and the Public Sentiments /Ratings for the same using public comments available on the video.

Motivation : 
In general, many of us have to spend time on going through the majority of the video or glance comment section to understand and realise the quality of the video, that could result in utter waste of time. So to overcome that issue, we created an application which classifies user comments of that Video and tries to show the overall sentiment from start to end of the comments section and with the help of LDA Methods it classifies the topic about the video.

Professional Touch:
We name this analytical application as CELENA. We can think of CELENA as an ALEXA or SIRI which we have been using for decades. Similarly, CELENA can be a mobile apps which can be our smart digital assistant which can assist with Sentiment Ratings and Topics of the video upfront
